## About This Project
PFTracker is a modern web-based flight tracker for Roblox, with a beautifully crafted, dark-themed dashboard and intuitive navigation. **This repository provides a React-based recreation of the dashboard UI** for reference, prototyping, or frontend experiments. 

- **No real data, APIs, or backend**‚Äîthis is *just* the visual/SPA shell.
- **Main goals:** learning, UI mimicry, code inspiration for dashboards.

## Screenshots

## What Is NOT Included & Why

| Feature/Area         | Included?    | Explanation                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------- |------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Live flight data     | ‚ùå           | No backend, no API keys. Data is private, proprietary, or not public.                                                          |
| Real interactive map | ‚ùå           | The map panel is a static container only. No real map, markers, or geodata shown.                                              |
| Login/auth           | ‚ùå           | Button is non-functional. No login modal/auth logic to avoid imitating real PFTracker infrastructure without authorization.    |
| Search/filter logic  | ‚ùå           | UI only; no implementation. Requires backend access and logic not publicly available.                                          |
| Notifications/toasts | ‚ùå           | No notification system. This requires a backend or client-side data/state, plus design access not public.                      |
| Real sub-pages       | ‚ùå           | "My Flight", "Flight Plan", and "Support" are placeholders‚Äîtrue internal content is not available without login/screenshots. |
| Mobile optimization  | üöß           | Best effort for desktop. No deep mobile testing or tailoring performed.                                                        |
| Real user/account    | ‚ùå           | User logic is outside of scope/intent.                                                                                         |
| Proprietary content  | ‚ùå           | No attempt is made to copy backend logic, private APIs, or any IP not visible on public pages.                                 |

**Why:**
- PFTracker is a proprietary app, and this clone is for UI inspiration or frontend prototyping only; no attempt is made to copy non-public features, business logic, or circumvent logins.
- Cloning backend integrations or handling user data would raise legal, ethical, and security concerns for both projects.
- If you are affiliated with PFTracker and want features added/removed, contact rzjx (see below).

## FAQ

### Q: Will this ever have real PFTracker functionality?
A: Not unless you own/provide backend endpoints, data, or API keys legally. This project‚Äôs intention is strictly for open UI demo purposes.

A: Yes! Use the codebase for reference, learning, or remixes‚Äîjust avoid misrepresenting it as the real PFTracker or violating any copyrights.

### Q: Can the ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù button be made functional?
A: You‚Äôd need to implement your own authentication hook-up, as this clone contains no such wiring.

### Q: Who owns the PFTracker brand or any assets?
A: All brand assets, logos, and original backend/content are property of PFTracker and its creators. This clone is for reference only.

### Q: How can I add more real pages?
